        <h3><u>INTRODUCTION </u></h3>
          <p>Doctrine to the church is what a foundation is to a building. it is the article of faith on which a believer's
            faith is anchored. A building with a weak foundation will collapse under intense unfavourable weather and 
            environmental condition while a building with solid foundation will hold firm through storms. (MATT. 7 vs 24 - 27).<br><br>
            A beliver's steadfastness and stability in the lord is dependent of a firm grasp of the truth revealed in the bible (EPH. 4 vs 13 - 14).<br><br>
            Lack of knowledge of the truth leads to backsliding and destruction ( HOSEA 4 vs 6). in a world of error and deceit engineered by satan and his
            hosts ( JOHN 8 vs 44), a believer needs to be well grounded in the truth in order to attack every lie inspired by satan if he/she is to remain in
            faith (MATT. 4 vs 3-4).
          </p>

          <li><h4> <u>THE HOLY BIBLE</u></h4></li>
          <h5><u>We Believe:</u></h5>
          <p>That the Holy Bible is the inspired word of God and is the only source of knowledge of the almighty God to mankind.
            it is the contact point between finite man and infinite God. And its prime purpose is to give mankind the revelation of God
            (II Tim. 3 vs 15 - 17).<br><br>
          We take the Bible as the final authority in all matters concerning Christain conduct and work. (PROV. 30 vs 5-6, REV. 22 vs 18 - 19).
        </p>
        
        <li><h4> <u>THE TRINITY</u></h4></li>
        <h5><u>We Believe:</u></h5>
        <p>That the Godhead consist of three seperate, distinct and recognisable personalities and qualities perfectly united in one.
          The Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost are different persons in the Godhead, not merely three names for one person (MATT. 28 vs 19 - 20).<br><br>
          The Father is called God (1 Cor. 8 vs 6, MATT. 6 vs 9), the Son, Jesus Christ, is called God (ISA. 9 vs 6 - 7, John 20 vs 28), and the Holy Ghost 
          is called God ( ACTS 5 vs 3 - 4, HEB. 10 vs 15 - 16).<br><br>
          The Godhead is the universal testimony of the scriptures, "For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the word ( Son ), and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one" ( 1 JOHN 5 vs 7).
        </p>
        
        <li><h4><u>THE VIRGIN BIRTH OF JESUS</u></h4></li>
        <h5><u>We Believe:</u></h5>
        <p>The virgin birth of Jesus, the only begotten son of God as well as his crucifixion, death, burial and bodily resurrection (ISA. 7 VS 14, MATT. 1 VS 18 - 25).<br><br>
          The virgin birth confirms christ deity and clearly distinguishes him as the only sinless man conceived without Adam depravity.
        </p>
        
        <li><h4><u>THE FALL OF MAN</u></h4></li>
        <h6><u>(TOTAL DEPRAVITY, SINFULNESS AND GUILT OF ALL MEN).</u></h6>
        <h5><u>We Believe:</u></h5>
        <p>Man was created in the image of God, and he was righteous and holy. (GEN. 1:26 -27), through voluntary disobedience and trangression, man fell into the depths of sin. As a concequence, everyone born through
          our first parents (Adam & Eve) became sinners, sharpened in iniquity and utterly void of the holiness of God. Every man became totally inclined to evil (GEN. 2 VS 15 - 17, ROM. 3 VS 10 - 18 & 23, ROM. 7 VS 14 - 21, ROM. 5 VS 12 - 19, PS. 51 VS 1 -5).<br><br>
          By inheriting the nature of sin, man became depraved and seperated from God. This seperation is the cause of man's sprrow, shame, fear, heartaches and manifold problems spritually and physically.
        </p>
        
        <li><h4><u>REPENTANCE</u></h4></li>
        <h5><u>We Believe:</u></h5>
        <P>That repentance is a conscious and complete turning away from all sins and its deceitful pleasures. That, repentance is required from every sinner before he can truly and effetively believe in Jesus with saving faith (PROV. 28 VS 13, ISA. 55 VS 7, EZEK. 18 VS 21 -23,
          MARK. 1 VS 15, ACTS 2 VS 38, ACTS 3 VS 19).<br><br>
          Repentance is also turning from Satan unto the Living God. Repentance evokes a change from the mind and purpose in life.<br><br>
          The need for repentance is the heartbeat of a deeply compassionate God (II PET. 3 VS 9).
        </P>
        
        <li><h4><u>RESTITUTION</u></h4></li>
        <h5><u>We Believe:</u></h5>
        <p>That restitution is making ammends for wrongs done against our fellowmen, restoring stolen things to their rightful owners, paying back just debts, giving back where one has defreuded, making confessions to the offened and apologizing to those slandered so to have a conscience 
          void of offence toward God and men (GEN. 20 VS 1-8, 14 - 18; EXD. 22 VS 1 - 7; LEV. 6 VS 1 - 7; NUM. 5 VS 6 - 8; PROV. 6 VS 30 - 31; EZK. 33 VS 14 - 16; MATT. 5 VS 23 - 24; LUKE 19 VS 8 - 9; ACTS 24 VS 16; JAMES 4 VS 17; LEV. 6 VS 1 - 7; NUM. 5 VS 6 - 8; PROV. 6 VS 30 - 31; EZK 33 VS 14 - 16;
          MATT. 5 VS 23 - 24; LUKE 19 VS 8 - 9; ACTS 24 VS 16; JAMES 4 VS 17). This is done whether the injured knew or not, for God knows (HEB. 4 VS 13).
        </p>
        <li><h4><u>JUSTIFICATION</u></h4></li>
        <h5><u>We Believe:</u></h5>
        <p>That justification is God's grace through which one receives forgiveness and remission of sins and is counted righteous before God, through faith in the atoning bloof of Jesus.<br><br>
          The need for justification becomes necessary as a man is incapable of personally providing a solution to his problem of sin or change his erternal destiny of damnation to meet the standard 
          of divine justice, due proce needed to be paid. Man lacked bothe the capacity and purity to afford this. It therefore required the sacrifice of the spotless Lamb of God, to pay the necessary ransom with his blood for the expiation of man's sins.<br><br>
          Having been cleared of every guilt of sin, the regenerated man stands before God as though he naver sinned, not on the basis of any personal merit but in the light of what Christ had accomplished for mankind by his substitutionary death on the cross at calvary (PS. 32 vs 1 -2; ISA. 1 VS 8, ACTS 13 VS 38 -39).
        </p>
        
        <li><h4><u>SANCTIFICATION</u></h4></li>
        <h5><u>We Believe:</u></h5>
        <P>That sanctification is a definite act of God's grace, subsequent to the new birth, by which the believer's heart is purified and made holy. It cannot be attained progressively by works, struggle of suppression, but it is obtained by faith in the sanctifying blood of Jesus Christ.<br><br>
          Sanctification means to make sacred or holy, to set apart for a holy or religious use to make free from moral corruption and pollution, it is the act of God's grace by which the affections of men are purified or alienated from sin and the world and exalted to supreme love for God, to purify in order to prepare for 
          divine service and for partaking of holy things, to free from the power of sin. ( LUKE 1 VS 74 - 75; JOHN 17 VS 15 - 17; 1THESS. 4 VS 3 - 4,7,8; TITUS 2 VS 11 - 14).
        </P>

        <li><h4><u>REDEMPTION, DIVINE HEALING & HEALTH</u></h4></li>
        <h5><u>We Believe:</u></h5>
        <p>That redemption from the curse of the law, healing of sickness and diseases and well as continued health are provided for all, through the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ (EXD. 15 VS 26, DEU. 7 VS 15, ISA. 53 VS 4 - 5, MATT. 8 VS 16 - 17, 1PETER 2 VS 24, MARK 16 VS 15 - 18, ACTS 10 VS 28, JAMES 5 VS 14 - 16, III JOHN 2, GAL.3 VS 13 - 14).<br><br>
          Redemption is purchasing back something previously sold. It is a release or liberation from captivity or debt by paying a price called a ransom. It simply means buying unto freedom someone in servitude, slavery or captivity.
        </p>
        
        <li><h4><u>WATER BAPTISM</u></h4></li>
        <h5><u>We Believe:</u></h5>
        <p>That water baptism is essential to our obedience after reconciliation with God. Water baptism is the only one immersion ( not three ) "in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost" as Jesus commanded. ( MATT. 28 VS 19,3 VS 13 - 17; MARK 16 VS 15 - 16; ACTS 19 VS 1 - 5; ROMANS 6 VS 4 -5).<br><br>
          When we submit for water baptism, it is a public declaration of our new relationshiop with God and a public ceremony which witnesses to all that one has put to Christ (GAL> 3 VS 27). The immersion signifies identification with the burial of Christ in his death and rising up in newness of life with him at his resurrection (ROMANS 6 VS 3 - 5; COL. 2 VS 12).
        </p>

        <li><h4><u>HOLY GHOST BAPTISM</u></h4></li>
        <h5><u>We Believe:</u></h5>
        <p>That the baptismin in the Holy Ghost is the endowment of power from on high upon the sanctified believer. It is "the promise of the Father" and when on receives this gift, it is accompained by the initial evidence of speaking a language unleared previously, referred to as speaking in tongues as the spirit gives utterance (MATT. 3 VS 11; LUKE 24 VS 29; JOHN 14 VS 16,17,26; ACTS 10 VS 44 - 46).<br><br>
          The mighty outpouring of the Holy Spirit is promised to all flesh and those who meet God's conditions can receive his abundance (ISA. 44 vs 3, EZK. 36 VS 25 - 27, JOEL 2 VS 28 - 29, JOHN 7 VS 37 -39).
        </p>

        <li><h4><u>THE LORD'S SUPPER</u></h4></li>
        <h5><u>We Believe:</u></h5>
        <P>
          That the Lord's supper or the holy communion  was instituted by Jesus Christ so that all believer's ( all member's of God family ) might partake thereof regularly to "show the Lord's death till he comes" the Lord's supper in the New Testament is a type of the feast of Passover in the Old Testament ( EXD. 12 VS 1 - 28, 40 - 51 ).<br><br>
          This implies that just as the vicarious death of the Lord Jesus replaced the sacrifice of the Aaronic or Levitical priesthood for atonement os sin, for us Christains, the Lord's Supper has replaced the feast of the passover, as an ordinance. (I COR. 10 VS 16; MATT. 26 VS 29; LUKE 22 VS 17 - 20; I COR. 11 VS 23 - 30).<br><br>
          Jesus Christ is our Passover Lamb ( I COR 5 VS 7).
        </P>

        <li><h4><u>EVANGELISM</u></h4></li>
        <h5><u>We Believe:</u></h5>
        <p>That personal evangelism is a God - given and God - ordained ministry for every believer. Jesus commands and God requires every believer to be a compassionate and fruitful soul - winner, bringing others to Christ ( MATT. 28 VS 19 - 20; MARK 16 VS 15; JOHN 17 VS 18; ACTS 1 VS 8; PROV. 11 VS 30; DANIEL 12 VS 3; EZIKEL 3 VS 17 - 21).<br><br>
          The gospel is good news from a loving God to a lost world that, through the death, burial and resurrection of Christ, there is salvation ( JOHN 3 vs 16 -17). Personal evangelism is the person - to - person sharing of this good news of salvation with the aim of soul - winning, leading the sinner to repent and turn wholly to God through Jesus Christ, the Saviour ( JOHN 1 VS 40 - 42; ACTS 8 VS 26 - 37).
        </p>

        <li><h4><u>MARRIAGE</u></h4></li>
        <h5><u>We Believe:</u></h5>
        <p>
          That marriage is a holy union, a living symbol, a precious relationship that needs tender self - sacrificing care. It is binding for life. monogamy is the uniform teaching of the bible. Marriage is God's idea and not a derivative of any culture. It is a gift from God to man and has three basic aspects:<br>
          <ol type="I">
            <li>
              <p style="font-weight: lighter;">The man leaves his parents and in a public act, pledges himself to his wife.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p style="font-weight: lighter;">The man and the woman are joined together by taking responsibility for each other's welfare and by loving the partner above all others.</p><br>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p style="font-weight: lighter;">The two become one flash in the intimacy and commitment to the wonderful union which is reserved for marriage. Thus, marriage provides fellowship, comfort, companionship and partnership. (GEN. 2 VS 18; HEB. 13 VS 4; NUM. 36 VS 6; MATT. 5 VS 31 - 32; II COR. 6 VS 14 ).</p>
            </li>
          </p>
          </ol>

          <li><h4><u>THE RAPTURE</u></h4></li>
          <h5><u>We Believe:</u></h5>
          <p>
            That the rapture ( commonly known as the first phase of the coming of Christ ) is the taking away from the earth of all living saints and all who died in the Lord. The rapture will take place before the great tribulation and can happen anytime from now ( JOHN 14 VS 1 - 3; LUKE 21 VS 34 - 36; I COR. 15 VS 51 - 58; II THESS. 2 VS 5 -7; I JOHN 3 VS 1 - 3).
            The rapture is no the same as the second coming of christ. At the rapture, Christ will appear in the air. He will not be visible to the inhabitants of the earth. His mission then will be to resurrect all dead saints, who along  with the living believers, will put on immortality and shall be caught up to be with him.<br><br>
            This event will take place "in the twinkling of an eye" before the great and terrible day of Lord, when the wrath of God will be event fitly called the great tribulation ( I COR. 15 VS 52 ). Second event will not take place until after the great tribulation.

        <li><h4><u>THE GREAT TRIBULATION</u></h4></li>
        <h5><u>We Believe:</u></h5>
        <p>
          That, the great tribulation will occur after the rapture and will be a time of terrible suffering on earth. It is also referred to as the time of "Jacob's trouble" ( MATT. 24 VS 21,22,29; II TESS. 2 VS 3 - 12; REV. 13). During this time, the Antichrist will take possession of this world for a reign of terror.<br><br>
          The bible shows that the great tribulation will take off after the rapture of the church ( ITHESS. 4 VS 13 - 18, REV. 4 VS 4 ) and will end at the second coming of Jesus Christ when He alights on Mount Olives ( ZECH. 14 VS 4; MATT 25 VS 31; REV. 19 VS 11 - 12; II THESS. 1 VS 7 - 10; JUDE 14 - 15) and settles on earth (Jerusalem) for a thousand year reign called the Millennial reign ( REV> 20 vs 4 - 5).
        </p>

        <li><h4><u>THE RESURRECTION OF THE DEAD</u></h4></li>
        <h5><u>We Believe:</u></h5>
        <p>
          That the resureecton of the dead is the immortality of the soul. Every individual whohas ever lived will be resurrected, some to honour the glory and others to everlasting shame and contempt ( JOB 19 VS 25 - 27; ISA. 26 VS 19; DAN. 12 VS 2; JOHN 5 VS 28 - 29; I COR. 15 VS 12 - 57; I THESS. 4 VS 13 - 16; REV 20 VS 6, 12, 13).<br><br>
          The resurrection of the dead is a cardinal and an important doctrine of the Bible. As a fact, all who died in this world will undergo physical resurrection before the great white throne judgment. This doctrine shows that there will be a resurrection of the body, joined with the soul to meet him ( as a judge ) in condemnation, eternal punishment and torment of hell fire.
        </p>
        
        <li><h4><u>THE SECOND COMING OF CHRIST</u></h4></li>
        <h5><u>We Believe:</u></h5>
        <p>
          That the second coming of christ will be just as literal and visible as his going away and he is coming to execute judgment upon the ungodly. He will also set up his kingdom and reign on the present earth for a thousand years ( ZECH. 143,4; MATT. 25 VS 31 - 46,26 VS 64; MARK 13 VS 24 - 37; II THESS. 1 VS 7 - 10; JUDE 14 VS 14 - 15 ).<br><br>
          The rapture should not be confused with the second coming. The two event are distinct and seperated by seven years. Specifically, the second coming refers to Christ's coming to the earth to live as he did in the first coming, to be seen by every eye. In rapture, Christ would nont come to the earth but stop in the air, where the saints will meet Him. Not every eyes will see Christ at the rapture.
        </p>

        <li><h4><u>MILLENNIAL REIGN OF CHRIST</u></h4></li>
        <h5><u>We Believe:</u></h5>
        <p>
          That christ Millennial reign is the 1,000 years literal reign of christ on earth, which will be ushered in by the coming of Christ back to earth with ten thousands of His saints. At this time he will judge the nations that dwell upon the face of the earth ( JUDE 14 - 15 ) during this time, the devil will be bound ( REV. 20 VS 2 - 3 ). It will be a reign of peace abd blessings ( ISA. 65 VS 25; HOSEA 2 VS 18; ZECH. 14 VS 9 - 20 ).<br><br>
          Thus, the Millennial reign of Christ is a thousand years of the full manifestation of his glory. According to God's revealed timetable, the church will suddenly be taken away by Christ ( ITHESS. 4 VS 13 - 18 ) in a misterious even known as the rapture. Then a seven years period of great suffering for sinners left behind will follow. ( MATT. 24 VS 21 - 22).<br><br>
          At the end of the seven years period, Jesus will come again with the church to establish His government ( JUDE 14 ). The government of this world at that time, will resist His coming. But the Lord will overcome at the battle of Armageddon ( REV. 19 VS 15 - 21 ). Satan will be bound and imprisoned for 1,000 years ( REV. 20 VS 1 -3). 
        </p>

        <li><h4><u>THE GREAT WHITE THRONE JUDGMENT </u></h4></li>
        <h5><u>We Believe:</u></h5>
        <p>
          That the great white throne judgment is when God will finally judge all ( the living and the dead, small and great ) who have ever lived on the earth, according to their works. This is after the Millennium. At this time, the final judgment known as the great white throne judgment will be held. All those, from all ages, who have not yet been judged i.e believers judgment for sin, borne and accomplisged by Christ on the cross ( JOHN 5 VS 24; 3 VS 17 - 19 ) will stand before God. The devil and his angels are
          judged at this time also and sent to the lake of fire forever. ( DAN. 12 VS 2 - 3; MATT. 11 VS 21 - 24; JOHN 5 VS 28 - 29; ROMANS 14 VS 12; II PETER 2 VS 9; JUDE 6; REV. 20 VS 11 - 15).<br><br>
          At the close of the Millennium, the devil will be released from "the bottomless pit" (REV. 20 VS 3) and he will deceive thousands of people and will gather them to fight against the King ( Jesus Christ ) and his saints. This will be the battle of Gog and Magog, but at the end of the battle, when the rebellious have been kiled and destroyed by te fire of his indignation which comes down from heaven, the devil will be cast into the lake of fire ( REV. 20 VS 7 - 10 ).<br><br>
          After this, the great white throne will be set. God will sit on a throne so white, magnificent and terrible at sight that the whole face of the earth and heaven ( atmospheric heaven ) will  tremble and flee from Him. All those who died unrepentant from the time of Adam till the time of the judgment will be resurrected. ( DAN. 12 VS 2; JOHN 5 VS 28 - 29; ACTS 24 VS 15 ). This is called the second resurrection. And they will all stand before God to account for their deeds. This final judgment of sinners ( the living and dead, small and great ) is known as the great white throne judgment ( PSALM 9 VS 17; DAN. 7 VS 9 - 10; JOHN 5 VS 28 - 29; REV. 20 VS 11 - 15).

        <li><h4><u>THE NEW HEAVEN AND THE NEW EARTH </u></h4></li>
        <h5><u>We Believe:</u></h5>
        <p>
          That the new heaven and the new earth "wherein dwelleth righteousness" will be made by God and the redeemed shall dwell therein with Him forever. This present earth which has been polluted by sin shall pass away after the great white throne judgment (ISA. 51 VS 6; ISA. 65 VS 17; MATT. 5 VS 18; MATT. 24 VS 35; REV. 21 VS 1; II PETER 3 VS 10 - 13). The land is under a curse ( GEN. 3 VS 17 ). The devil and all his fallen angels walk to and fro the whole earth having polluted the atmospheric heavens by their activities. <br><br>
          The believers of today groan under the harsh and hard conditions of the earth looking forward to a change ( a new heaven and new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness and holiness ). God has the ultimate plan to judge sinners who remains obstinate to the call of God's repentance. ( REV. 20 VS 15 ) with the fina judgment of sinners, God's divine plan is to replace this polluted evil earth and atmospheric heavens with a new earth and atmospheric heavens, which will match his glory, holiness and righteousness ( REV. 21 VS 1 - 7; ISAIAH 65 VS 17; II PETER 3 VS 7; II PETER 10 VS 14) gives us a good picture of what shall become of this present earth and heavens. All what 
          we call beautiful edifies and empires today will melt away in fervent heat.

        <li><h4><u>HELL </u></h4></li>
        <h5><u>We Believe:</u></h5>
        <p>
          That hell fire is a place of everlasting punishment where sinners ( all who do not have their names in the book of life ) will suffer torments forever.<br><br>
          It was prepared for the devil and his angles ( MATT. 25 VS 41 ) but God has decreed that the wicked and those who forget him and reject Christ will also be cast there because of their sin and neglect of his salvation ( PSALM 9 VS 17; MATT. 25 VS 46; LUKE 16 VS 19 - 31; MARK 9 VS 43 - 47; REV. 14 VS 10 - 11; 20 VS 10, 12; 15 ).<br><br>
          The fact and reality of hell is an important and recurring theme in the scriptures. It is vividly captured as a place of agonizing torment and everlasting punishment in an unquenchable fire for the uncoverted ( MATT. 25 VS 41; MARK 9 VS 43 - 48; LUKE 16 VS 23 & 28)
